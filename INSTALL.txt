After enable of elysia_cron module from drupal module administration you should
follow this steps:
 
1) Elysia_cron must "override" standard drupal cron. To do so there are two
   ways:
   - replace standard cron.php with the one in the elysia_cron package.
     This is the optimized way, but you must remember to not
     replace cron.php when upgrading drupal core.
   - enable "runtime replacement" in elysia_cron setup. This is a cleaner 
     way, but it adds a little overhead to cron execution (standard cron execution
     is started, then forced to terminate by elysia_cron handler).
 
2) You should change the server crontab to launch drupal cron process each minute.
   Refer to the section "Configuring cron jobs" of drupal documentation
   (http://drupal.org/cron), the only difference is that the schedule rule
   must be "* * * * *".
   Example:
   * * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php

   If you want to enable cron-key security you should also add the choosen
   cron key (from elysia_cron setup) to the call.
   Example:
   * * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php?cron_key=XYZ

3) Give 'administer elysia_cron' permission to all user roles that needs to
   administer cron jobs.

Nothing more.
By default elysia_cron will run all standard cron jobs sequentially (in a single
channel) each 15 minutes.
You can change this behavious with elysia_cron setup.

Note: to better see warnings on administration page you should consider adding 
a rule for "warn" class to theme CSS stylesheet, like this one:
.warn { color: red; font-weight: bold; }
