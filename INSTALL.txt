After enable of elysia_cron module from drupal module administration you should 
change the server crontab to launch drupal cron process each minute.
To do this refer to the section "Configuring cron jobs" of drupal documentation
(http://drupal.org/cron), the only difference is that the schedule rule must 
be "* * * * *".
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php

If you want to enable cron-key security you should also add the choosen
cron key (from elysia_cron setup) to the call.
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php?cron_key=XYZ

You can also give 'administer elysia_cron' permission to all user roles that 
needs to administer cron jobs. 

Nothing more.
By default elysia_cron will run all standard cron jobs sequentially (in a single
channel) each 15 minutes.
You can change this behavious with elysia_cron setup.

To access elysia_cron setup, and change the scheduling of your jobs or view
execution stats, go to page admin/build/cron

Note: to better see warnings on administration page you should consider adding 
a rule for "warn" class to theme CSS stylesheet, like this one:
.warn { color: red; font-weight: bold; }

ADVANCED
---------

With the standard installation described above elysia cron will be launched
by standard drupal cron.
This add a (very very) little overhead to all cron calls.
I suggest to ignore that, however if you want you can completely skip drupal
cron (and launch elysia_cron directly) by replacing file "cron.php" in the
root of drupal dir with the one in the elysia_cron package.
If you do so you must remember to not replace cron.php when upgrading drupal
core.
